#Clothes Recognition with ANN

## Project Purpose
The aim of the project is to make clothes classification with the usage of self implemented artificial neural network and its modified version.
The modification implemented to neural networks were based on Yann LeCun article named 'Efficient Backprop'.

## Artificial Naural Network Classification
The input layer of the network consists of 784 neurons - each represents one pixel of the cloth image which size is 28x28. 
Each neuron of the last layer represents probability of corresponding to it class. For the classification of the image, the class with the highest probability is chosen.
